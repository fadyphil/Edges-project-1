# 🍳 Recipe Challenge App

> **My First Flutter Project** | Focused on State Management & BLoC Pattern

A mobile application that challenges users to cook new recipes. This project was built to master the fundamentals of **Flutter** and rigorous state management using **BLoC (Business Logic Component)**.

---

### 🚀 Key Features
* **Recipe Feed:** Browse a list of cooking challenges.
* **State Management:** Robust handling of UI states (Loading, Success, Error) using BLoC.
* **Reactive UI:** Screens update automatically based on state changes without `setState` spaghetti code.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Framework:** Flutter (Dart)
* **State Management:** `flutter_bloc`
* **Architecture:** UI and Logic separation

### 💡 What I Learned
As my first step into mobile development, this project taught me:
1.  How to separate **Business Logic** from **UI** code.
2.  Understanding Streams and Events in Dart.
3.  Structuring a Flutter project for scalability from Day 1.

### **Actionable Advice to Improve the Repo**
To make this repository look 10x better to anyone visiting your profile:

1.  **Rename the Repository (Optional):** `Edges-project-1` is a bit vague. Changing the name to `flutter-recipe-challenge` (in the Settings tab of the repo) makes it instantly searchable and clear.
2.  **Add the "About" Section on the Sidebar:**
    * Go to your repo page.
    * Click the ⚙️ icon next to "About" on the right sidebar.
    * **Description:** "A Recipe Challenge app built to practice BLoC and State Management in Flutter."
    * **Topics:** Add `flutter`, `bloc`, `dart`, `beginner-project`.
3.  **Upload Screenshots:** A visual is worth 1,000 lines of code. Even if the UI is simple, showing that it *runs* is crucial.
